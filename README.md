# why_i_hate_trump

There is a lot of infosec people going full mask off trump supporter right now. Which doens't suprise me because infosec has always been an awful collection of people.

Being transgender and being public about it since 2018, I have experienced the shift. Only in the last couple of years have people in Trump's orbit started attacking and demonizing trans people.
Quality of life has quickly started to degrade in those years due to public harassment.
I.e people shouting things like "p*do" at me from their car while I was out running at the microsoft campus. People calling me a creep or freak. 
Just because of who I am while minding my own fucking business. Ofcourse if the politicians get a pass saying these things, so can they.

It also wouldn't suprise me if all that rethoric contributed to getting threatened with a gun in Redmond outside my appartment.
And shortly after that fired from Microsoft due to a mental break down on campus from all the harassment.
It is not just in public, also in the work setting. They fired my manager for giving me a promotion, I only ever made it to SE II after 4 years, but even that was *too much* according to HR.
Despite finding bugs in very critical components. They portrayed me as incompetent, someone who shouldn't have been there.. and thus also fired the manager who had hired me. Who had been at Msft for nearly 3 decades.

I have seen the world change due to Trump and his goons. 
I know where this is going too. And all you trump fan boys are fucking morrons. 
I will resist, for as long as Trump is president, america is the enemy. The enemy of decency. I will fight the enemy. Come at me cowards.
